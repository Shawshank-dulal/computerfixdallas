        <p>Computer maintenance entails regularly cleaning, hard drive updates, and virus prevention on your PCs and laptops. Creating a computer maintenance checklist makes it easy to track the process. When properly maintained, computers can survive five to eight years, but if the user does not take precautions to protect the hardware, that lifespan can be cut short fast. Cleaning your devices will help them last longer and help you access the web more safely. This is why computer upkeep is so critical.</p>

            <h2>Cleaning Hardware</h2>
            <p>Cleaning your keyboard at least once a week can help keep it in good shape. Wipe your keyboard down with a wet, lint-free cloth, but don't soak it in water. Wipe down your monitor once a week with a dry lint-free cloth to keep it looking fresh and clean. Turn your mouse upside down after unplugging it. After that, detach the bottom panel and use a lint-free cloth to clean the ball. Before reassembling the mouse for a more thorough clean, soak the cloth in rubbing alcohol, allowing the ball to dry.</p>

            <h2>Proper Malware Protection</h2>
            <p>For personal Computer Maintenance, run an antivirus program update the same day it becomes available to remove viruses. These updates can provide new software features or improve existing ones. Changing your password four times a year keeps you safer without causing too much trouble. Firmware is a little piece of software that keeps your computer's hardware running smoothly. These upgrades are sometimes included in significant computer updates, but you can also manually check for firmware updates on many devices. In addition to program updates, you'll want to update your signatures. This guarantees that your computer is free of new viruses.</p>
